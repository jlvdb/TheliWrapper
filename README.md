Command line wrapper for the THELI package for automated astronomical data reduction


### Installation Packages

You can download *THELI*, which is a requirement for the *TheliWrapper* from below. The version provided just comes with the base data and does *NOT* include the graphical user interface. If you want to use it, or want to make sure you get the most recent verions, refer to the [original download page](https://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/theli/gui/download.html)

* [THELI - base package](https://github.com/jlvdb/TheliWrapper/raw/gh-pages/INSTALL/theli-1.9.5.tgz)
* [THELI - scripts, no GUI](https://github.com/jlvdb/TheliWrapper/raw/gh-pages/INSTALL/gui-2.10.3_modified.tar.gz)


### [GitHub - Wiki Page](https://github.com/jlvdb/TheliWrapper/wiki)

Providing documentation and instructions on how to reduce the demo data, which you find below.


### Demo Data

Download and extract these data archives in the same folder (e.g. `DEMO`):

* [Calibration - bias frames](https://github.com/jlvdb/TheliWrapper/raw/gh-pages/usage-demo/BIAS.tar.bz2)
* [Calibration - flat fields](https://github.com/jlvdb/TheliWrapper/raw/gh-pages/usage-demo/FLAT.tar.bz2)
* [Observation](https://github.com/jlvdb/TheliWrapper/raw/gh-pages/usage-demo/SCIENCE.tar.bz2)

The data structure should look like this:
    
    DEMO
       ↳ BIAS
       ↳ FLAT
       ↳ SCIENCE
